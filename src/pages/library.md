This is a list of all books that I've read and I can remember of. I've ranked them based on a rating out of 10 that I feel like. For some of these books, you can read my notes on the same. I mainly read using my Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, so for ebooks I've made some notes. I've published book notes for some of the books mentioned below. You can also check out my anti-library where I keep the list books that I want to read someday in the future. To know more about what I'm reading now, head over to the Now section.


All the books that I have recently read are listed here.<br>
